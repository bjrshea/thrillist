# Thrillist Re-Creation

#### Epicodus project, 10.19.18

#### By Brendan Shea

## Description

If you're looking for good food, drink, or attractions in city that's unfamiliar for to you, Thrillist is your spot.

As a class project, I re-created Thrillist's homepage using Angular. The site is constructed using multiple components and models to resemble the real thing.

DISCLAIMER: This is still a work in progress and likely won't be complete until the end of the month.
