#### Epicodus project, 10.19.18

#### By Brendan Shea

## Description

If you're looking for good food, drink, or attractions in city that's unfamiliar for to you, Thrillist is your spot.

As a class project, I re-created Thrillist's homepage using Angular. The site is constructed using multiple components and models to resemble the real thing.

## Construction

* **Model:** houses the construction that's used to build the data structures in the app component.
* **App Component:** houses the data that is passed down to the children component.
* **Header Component:** hard coded header information.
* **Jumbo Article Component:** pulls data from the `bigFeaturedArticles` array in the app component.
* **Featured Article Component:** pulls data from the `featuredArticles` array in the app component.
* **Featured Movie Component:** pulls data from the `bigFeaturedMovies` array in the app component.
* **Header Component:** hard coded footer information.
